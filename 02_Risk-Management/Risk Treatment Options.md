# Risk Treatment Options

## Overview
Risk treatment refers to the actions an organization takes to manage identified risks in alignment with its risk appetite and security objectives. Once a risk has been evaluated for likelihood and impact, an appropriate treatment strategy must be selected. These strategies help determine whether a risk should be reduced, transferred, avoided, or accepted. Clear documentation of treatment decisions supports accountability, audit readiness, and consistent risk management practices.

## Mitigate
Mitigation involves implementing controls to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk. This is the most common treatment option in cybersecurity. Examples include deploying technical safeguards, enhancing monitoring, improving configurations, or updating policies and procedures. Mitigation is appropriate when the risk is significant but can be reduced to an acceptable level through practical measures.

## Transfer
Transfer shifts the financial or operational consequences of a risk to another party. Common examples include purchasing cyber insurance, outsourcing certain services, or incorporating contractual clauses with vendors. Transfer does not eliminate the risk completely but moves responsibility for specific impacts or costs away from the organization. This strategy is often used when risks cannot be mitigated effectively in-house.

## Avoid
Avoidance eliminates the risk entirely by discontinuing or modifying the activity that introduces the risk. For example, an organization may choose not to implement a risky feature, retire a vulnerable legacy system, or decline a high-risk vendor. Avoidance is suitable when the risk level is too high and cannot be mitigated to an acceptable level.

## Accept
Acceptance acknowledges that a risk exists and chooses not to take additional action, often because the residual risk is within the organization’s risk appetite. A formal acceptance decision requires justification and documentation, ideally approved by leadership or risk owners. Acceptance is appropriate for low-impact risks or situations where mitigation efforts are disproportionate to the potential harm.

## Role in This Toolkit
These treatment options guide how risks identified in the Risk Register should be addressed. As additional examples, workflows, and templates are added, this document will support decision-making and ensure consistent application of risk treatment strategies across different assessments.
