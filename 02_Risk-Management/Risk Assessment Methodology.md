# Risk Assessment Methodology

## Overview
A risk assessment methodology provides a consistent approach for evaluating cybersecurity risks by defining how likelihood and impact are measured and how overall risk levels are determined. A standardized methodology helps ensure that risks across different systems and departments are evaluated objectively, making it easier for decision-makers to prioritize mitigation efforts. This document outlines a simple qualitative method suitable for most organizations and projects.

## Likelihood Assessment
Likelihood refers to the probability that a threat will exploit a vulnerability. It is typically evaluated using qualitative ratings such as Low, Medium, or High. A **Low** likelihood indicates that the risk scenario is unlikely or rarely observed, while a **Medium** likelihood suggests that the event could occur under certain conditions. A **High** likelihood rating is used when there is a strong possibility of occurrence based on historical data, known vulnerabilities, or active threat activity. Likelihood should consider factors such as exposure, attacker capability, existing controls, and ease of exploitation.

## Impact Assessment
Impact represents the potential consequences to the organization if a risk materializes. Like likelihood, impact is often evaluated using Low, Medium, or High ratings. A **Low** impact might result in minor operational inconvenience, while a **Medium** impact could disrupt business functions, increase recovery costs, or reduce service quality. A **High** impact typically involves significant consequences such as data loss, regulatory violations, financial damage, or harm to the organization’s reputation. Impact assessments should account for confidentiality, integrity, availability, legal implications, and business continuity.

## Determining Inherent Risk
Inherent risk is the level of risk that exists before any controls or mitigations are applied. It is calculated by evaluating the combination of likelihood and impact based on the initial conditions of the system or environment. Organizations may use qualitative matrices to categorize inherent risk as Low, Medium, High, or Critical. Understanding inherent risk helps prioritize which issues require immediate attention.

## Determining Residual Risk
Residual risk is the level of risk that remains after existing controls and mitigation efforts have been considered. It reflects the effectiveness of implemented measures and whether additional action is needed. In some cases, residual risk may be acceptable if it aligns with the organization’s risk appetite. If residual risk remains too high, further controls or alternative strategies may be required.

## Applying the Methodology
This methodology should be used when populating the risk register included in this toolkit. By consistently evaluating likelihood, impact, inherent risk, and residual risk, organizations can maintain transparency in risk decision-making and ensure alignment across teams. As the toolkit expands, additional examples and visual risk matrices may be added to further support the assessment process.
