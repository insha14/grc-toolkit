# Risk Management Overview

## Overview
Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and responding to potential events that could negatively impact an organization’s operations, assets, or reputation. In cybersecurity, risk management helps prioritize which threats and vulnerabilities should be addressed first based on their likelihood and potential impact. Effective risk management allows organizations to allocate resources appropriately, strengthen security controls, and make informed decisions about acceptable levels of risk.

## Key Concepts
Cybersecurity risk is typically evaluated by examining the relationship between threats, vulnerabilities, and assets. A threat represents something that could cause harm, while a vulnerability is a weakness that could be exploited by that threat. The value or importance of the asset being impacted determines the severity of potential consequences. Risk management focuses on understanding these relationships and determining where preventive or corrective measures are needed.

## Risk Management Activities
A typical risk management process includes identifying risks, analyzing their severity, determining appropriate mitigation strategies, and monitoring risks over time. Mitigation strategies may involve implementing new controls, enhancing existing controls, transferring risk through contracts or insurance, accepting risk when it aligns with the organization’s risk appetite, or avoiding activities that introduce unnecessary risk. Risk management is an ongoing process that evolves as technology, business operations, and threat landscapes change.

## Role in GRC Work
Risk management is foundational to governance, risk, and compliance. It influences policy development, control selection, audit planning, and incident response procedures. Understanding how risks are identified, measured, and treated allows GRC professionals to support both operational security teams and executive decision-makers. Within this toolkit, the risk management section provides templates, methodologies, and practical examples to help perform consistent and structured risk assessments.
