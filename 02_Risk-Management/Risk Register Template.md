# Risk Register Template

## Overview
A risk register is a structured document used to record, evaluate, and track cybersecurity risks within an organization. It provides a standardized way to analyze threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, impact, and the effectiveness of existing controls. A well-maintained risk register supports informed decision-making, prioritization of mitigation efforts, and clear communication between technical teams and leadership. This template provides a simple format that can be adapted for different environments and levels of security maturity.

## How to Use This Template
Each row in the risk register represents a single identified risk. The register captures details such as the affected asset, the nature of the threat, the vulnerability being exploited, and the initial (inherent) level of risk. It then documents any existing controls, proposed mitigation actions, and the resulting (residual) risk level after those actions are implemented. This format ensures consistency and clarity when assessing and managing multiple risks across a system or project.

|---------|------------------|--------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------|--------|
| 1       |                  |                    |               |                                  |                               |                       |                   |                      |                       |            |        |

| 3       |                  |                    |               |                                  |                               |                       |                   |                      |                       |            |        |

## Notes
- **Inherent Risk** refers to the level of risk before any controls are implemented.  
- **Residual Risk** refers to the level of risk after controls and mitigation actions have been applied.  
- **Likelihood and Impact** should be assessed using the risk methodology provided in this toolkit.  
- **Risk Owner** is the person or team responsible for addressing or monitoring the risk.  
- **Status** may include labels such as Open, In Progress, Mitigated, Accepted, or Closed.

This template can be used as-is for documentation or adapted into an Excel-based risk register for more complex tracking and reporting needs.
