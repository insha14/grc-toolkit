# Access Control Policy

## Overview
The Access Control Policy defines the requirements for managing user access to systems, applications, and data within the organization. Its purpose is to ensure that access rights are granted based on business needs, monitored appropriately, and removed promptly when no longer required. Effective access control protects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets.

## Purpose
This policy establishes rules for granting, modifying, reviewing, and revoking access to organizational systems. It supports compliance with industry standards and reduces risks associated with unauthorized access, privilege misuse, and data exposure. The policy provides clear expectations for employees, managers, system owners, and administrators.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, third-party users, and service accounts that access organizational systems or data. It covers all applications, networks, devices, cloud environments, and information repositories owned or managed by the organization.

## Policy Requirements

### User Access Provisioning
Access shall be granted only after receiving proper authorization from the system owner or manager responsible for the data. Access requests must follow a documented approval process, and permissions must align with the user’s job responsibilities.

### User Access Deprovisioning
Access must be revoked promptly when an employee changes roles, leaves the organization, or no longer requires access. HR must notify IT or security teams immediately upon termination to ensure timely removal of accounts.

### Least Privilege and Segregation of Duties
Users must be granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their duties. Privileged access should be limited to authorized personnel and monitored closely. Segregation of duties must be enforced to prevent conflicts of interest or unauthorized system activity.

### Authentication Requirements
All user accounts must follow strong authentication practices. Passwords shall meet defined complexity standards, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) must be used for administrative access or systems containing sensitive data.

### Access Reviews
System owners must conduct periodic reviews of user access to ensure permissions remain appropriate. Access review results should be documented, and any identified discrepancies must be remediated promptly.

### Shared and Service Accounts
Shared accounts should be avoided whenever possible. If shared or service accounts are necessary, they must have documented ownership, restricted privileges, and appropriate monitoring. Passwords for such accounts must be stored securely and changed regularly.

### Logging and Monitoring
Access-related activities—including logins, failed authentication attempts, and privilege escalations—must be logged and monitored regularly. Alerts should be configured for suspicious or unauthorized activity.

## Enforcement
Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, including account suspension, retraining, or termination. Significant violations may require escalation to executive leadership or legal authorities.

## Review and Maintenance
This policy shall be reviewed annually or following major organizational, technological, or regulatory changes. Updates must be approved by executive leadership or the designated security governance team.
