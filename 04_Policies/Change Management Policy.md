# Change Management Policy

## Overview
The Change Management Policy defines the requirements for planning, approving, testing, and implementing changes to information systems, applications, and infrastructure. Its purpose is to ensure that changes are introduced in a controlled and predictable manner, minimizing the risk of system outages, security vulnerabilities, and unauthorized modifications. A structured change management process improves system reliability and supports organizational compliance obligations.

## Purpose
This policy provides a consistent framework for documenting and managing changes to technology environments. It ensures that changes undergo appropriate review and testing, that risks are assessed, and that approvals are obtained before deployment. The policy supports audit readiness, operational stability, and stronger security practices across the organization.

## Scope
This policy applies to all changes affecting production systems, business applications, cloud environments, network components, and any supporting infrastructure. It covers both planned and emergency changes performed by employees, contractors, or managed service providers.

## Policy Requirements

### Change Request Documentation
All changes must be documented through an authorized change management system or ticketing process. Documentation must include a description of the change, business justification, affected systems, implementation steps, rollback plans, and associated risks.

### Approval and Authorization
Changes must be reviewed and approved by appropriate stakeholders before implementation. Standard changes may follow pre-approved workflows, while high-risk or complex changes require additional review by change advisory groups or technical leads.

### Testing and Validation
All changes must be tested in an appropriate environment prior to implementation. Testing should verify functionality, compatibility, and security impact. Evidence of testing must be captured as part of the change record.

### Emergency Changes
Emergency changes required to address outages, security threats, or urgent business needs must follow an expedited approval process. These changes must be reviewed and documented after implementation to ensure compliance and effectiveness.

### Implementation and Rollback
Changes must be scheduled and communicated to minimize disruption. Implementation steps must follow approved procedures, and rollback plans must be available in case the change needs to be reversed. High-risk changes require monitoring immediately after deployment to identify issues quickly.

### Logging and Monitoring
All changes must be logged, and monitoring systems must be used to detect unauthorized or unexpected modifications. Logs and audit trails should be retained for analysis and review.

## Enforcement
Failure to follow this policy may result in disciplinary action, suspension of deployment privileges, or management escalation. Serious violations that compromise security or availability may prompt additional corrective actions.

## Review and Maintenance
This policy shall be reviewed annually or after significant system updates, audit findings, or organizational changes. Revisions must be approved by the designated change management owner or executive leadership.
