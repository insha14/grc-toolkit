# Vendor Risk Management Policy

## Overview
The Vendor Risk Management Policy defines the requirements for evaluating, monitoring, and managing risks associated with third-party service providers. Because vendors often handle sensitive data or provide critical services, weaknesses in their security practices can directly impact the organization. This policy ensures that third-party risks are identified, assessed, and mitigated throughout the vendor lifecycle.

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish a consistent framework for selecting vendors, conducting due diligence, reviewing security practices, and monitoring ongoing compliance. It supports the organization’s commitment to protecting information assets, meeting regulatory obligations, and maintaining a secure supply chain. The policy also provides guidance for terminating vendor relationships safely when necessary.

## Scope
This policy applies to all third-party vendors, contractors, cloud service providers, and business partners that access, process, store, or manage organizational data or systems. It covers both existing and prospective vendors and applies to all departments involved in procurement or vendor management activities.

## Policy Requirements

### Vendor Classification
Vendors must be classified based on the sensitivity of the data they handle and the criticality of the services they provide. Higher-risk vendors require more detailed assessments and enhanced monitoring. Classification criteria may include data exposure, access level, business impact, and regulatory requirements.

### Due Diligence and Security Assessments
Before engaging a vendor, the organization must perform a security assessment appropriate to the vendor’s classification. Assessments may include reviewing SOC 2 or ISO 27001 reports, completing security questionnaires, evaluating incident history, and verifying data protection practices. High-risk vendors may require more in-depth evaluations or contractual security clauses.

### Contractual Security Requirements
Contracts with vendors must include appropriate security and compliance provisions. These may include confidentiality obligations, breach notification requirements, data handling expectations, audit rights, and service level agreements (SLAs). Legal and procurement teams must review language to ensure alignment with organizational risk tolerance.

### Monitoring and Review
Vendor risk must be monitored throughout the relationship. This includes periodic reviews of performance, compliance status, updated audit reports, or changes in services. Significant changes—such as mergers, security incidents, or expanded access—must trigger re-evaluation of the vendor’s risk profile.

### Termination and Offboarding
When a vendor relationship ends, access to systems and data must be revoked promptly. Data provided to the vendor must be returned or securely destroyed in accordance with contractual requirements. Offboarding activities must be documented to ensure proper closure.

## Enforcement
Non-compliance with this policy may delay vendor onboarding, lead to suspension of vendor services, or require reassessment of contractual agreements. Employees who bypass vendor review processes may face disciplinary action.

## Review and Maintenance
This policy shall be reviewed annually or when significant changes occur in regulatory requirements, vendor landscape, or business operations. Updates must be approved by senior management or the designated risk oversight committee.
