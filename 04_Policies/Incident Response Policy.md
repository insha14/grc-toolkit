# Incident Response Policy

## Overview
The Incident Response Policy defines the processes and responsibilities for detecting, reporting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents. The goal of this policy is to minimize the impact of security events, ensure timely communication, and support effective recovery. A structured incident response process helps organizations reduce downtime, limit data loss, and maintain trust with customers and stakeholders.

## Purpose
This policy establishes the framework for managing security incidents in a consistent and coordinated manner. It outlines the expectations for employees, technical teams, and management when responding to incidents. The policy ensures compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards while improving the organization’s ability to handle cyber threats.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, third-party service providers, and systems that store, process, or transmit organizational data. It covers all types of security incidents, including but not limited to unauthorized access, malware infections, data breaches, service disruptions, and policy violations.

## Policy Requirements

### Incident Identification and Reporting
Any employee or system detecting unusual or suspicious activity must report it immediately to the designated security team. Detection methods may include automated monitoring tools, user reports, or system alerts. All incidents must be logged and categorized based on severity.

### Incident Response Team Responsibilities
The organization shall maintain an Incident Response Team (IRT) responsible for coordinating investigation, containment, eradication, and recovery efforts. The team must have clearly defined roles, including incident handlers, forensic analysts, system owners, and communication leads.

### Incident Classification
Incidents must be classified according to their potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Classification levels help determine response urgency, required resources, and notification procedures.

### Containment and Eradication
Immediate steps must be taken to contain the incident and prevent further damage. This may involve isolating affected systems, disabling compromised accounts, or blocking malicious network traffic. Eradication includes removing malware, closing vulnerabilities, or applying patches.

### Recovery and Restoration
Systems must be restored to normal operation following containment and eradication. Recovery activities may include restoring from backups, validating system integrity, and monitoring for recurring issues. Any lessons learned must be incorporated into future improvements.

### Communication and Notification
The incident response team must ensure timely communication with internal stakeholders, including management and affected users. External notifications—such as customers, regulators, or partners—must follow legal and contractual requirements.

### Documentation and Lessons Learned
All incidents must be documented thoroughly, including root cause analysis, impact assessment, and remediation activities. A post-incident review must be conducted to identify improvements to processes, controls, and training.

## Enforcement
Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, including suspension of access, retraining, or termination. Repeated violations may lead to management escalation.

## Review and Maintenance
This policy shall be reviewed annually or after significant incidents, regulatory changes, or technological updates. Revisions must be approved by the designated governance authority or executive leadership.
