# Vendor Register

## Overview
The Vendor Register provides a centralized list of all third-party vendors, the services they offer, the data they access, and their associated risk levels. It supports vendor risk management, compliance requirements, and audit readiness.

## Purpose
This register helps track vendor onboarding, assessments, certifications, contract renewals, and risk reviews. It aligns with your Vendor Risk Management Policy and Vendor Onboarding Workflow.

## Notes
- High-risk vendors should be reviewed annually or after major incidents.  
- Compliance reports (SOC 2, ISO 27001) should be stored with vendor files.  
- Vendors with access to sensitive data must complete a security assessment.  
- Offboard unused vendors to reduce risk exposure.
