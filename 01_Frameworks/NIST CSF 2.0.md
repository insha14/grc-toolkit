# 🛡️ NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 — Summary
**A simple, beginner-friendly guide for quick understanding and practical use.**

---

## 🔎 1. Overview  
The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** is a globally recognized model that helps organizations understand, manage, and reduce cybersecurity risk.  
It is flexible, scalable, and used widely across industries.

CSF 2.0 organizes cybersecurity work into **6 Core Functions**, which represent the full lifecycle of managing cyber risk.

## 🧩 2. The Six Core Functions (CSF 2.0)

### **1️⃣ Govern**  
Establish cybersecurity risk strategy, responsibilities, oversight, and policies.  
**Examples:**  
- Defining roles and responsibilities  
- Approving cybersecurity policies  

---

### **2️⃣ Identify**  
Understand what assets, systems, people, and data need protection.  
**Examples:**  
- Maintaining an asset inventory  
- Understanding business context  
- Identifying vulnerabilities  

---

### **3️⃣ Protect**  
Implement safeguards to limit or contain cybersecurity risks.  
**Examples:**  
- MFA  
- Access controls  
- Encryption  
- Security awareness training  

---

### **4️⃣ Detect**  
Identify cybersecurity events as early as possible.  
**Examples:**  
- Log monitoring  
- Use of SIEM  
- Detection of anomalies  

---

### **5️⃣ Respond**  
Take action when an incident is detected.  
**Examples:**  
- Activating the incident response plan  
- Containment and eradication  
- Communication with stakeholders  

---

### **6️⃣ Recover**  
Restore normal operations and learn from incidents.  
**Examples:**  
- Restoring backups  
- Updating processes  
- Conducting post-incident reviews  

---

## 🏗️ 3. Structure of CSF 2.0  
Each Function is broken down into:  
✔ **Categories** (high-level outcomes)  
✔ **Subcategories** (specific tasks/outcomes)

Example:  
**Protect → Access Control → Implement least privilege**

## 🎯 4. Why CSF Matters in GRC  
- Helps build **policies and procedures**  
- Supports **risk assessments**  
- Maps easily to ISO 27001, SOC 2, CIS Controls  
- Used by auditors and security leaders worldwide  
- Provides a shared language for security teams  

---

## 🛠️ 5. How This Fits Into Your Toolkit  
You will use CSF for:  
- Writing policies  
- Building risk assessments  
- Creating audit checklists  
- Mapping controls across frameworks  

This is one of the foundational components of your GRC toolkit.
