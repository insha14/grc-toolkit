# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 — Summary

## Overview
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a widely used model that helps organizations understand, manage, and reduce cybersecurity risks. It is flexible, scalable, and suitable for organizations of all sizes. CSF 2.0 is built around six core functions that together represent the full lifecycle of managing cybersecurity risk across an organization.

## The Six Core Functions
The **Govern** function establishes the organization's cybersecurity governance by defining risk strategy, assigning roles and responsibilities, and providing oversight for security policies. The **Identify** function focuses on understanding what needs protection by assessing assets, systems, data, business environment, and vulnerabilities. The **Protect** function includes safeguards such as access controls, authentication, secure configurations, data protection mechanisms, and employee training to ensure services operate securely.

The **Detect** function ensures that cybersecurity events are discovered promptly through continuous monitoring, logging, and anomaly detection. The **Respond** function provides guidance on how the organization should act once an incident is detected, including containment, communication, analysis, and mitigation activities. Finally, the **Recover** function focuses on restoring normal operations after an incident and improving processes through lessons learned, backup restoration, and service recovery planning.

## CSF 2.0 Structure
Each core function contains categories, and each category is further broken into subcategories that define specific cybersecurity outcomes. For example, under the Protect function, the Access Control category includes outcomes such as implementing least privilege. This structure makes CSF both comprehensive and easy to map to other frameworks like ISO 27001, SOC 2, and CIS Controls.

## Importance for GRC Work
CSF is especially useful in governance, risk, and compliance because it provides a clear, standardized way to assess security posture, identify gaps, and build policies. It supports risk assessments, aligns well with audits, and offers a common language for security teams, leadership, and stakeholders. Its widespread adoption across industries also makes it a reliable foundation for both compliance and operational security work.

## Role in This Toolkit
Within this toolkit, the NIST CSF summary serves as a foundational reference for policy development, control mapping, risk assessment workflows, and audit preparation. As the toolkit expands, additional frameworks will be added to complement CSF and provide broader coverage for GRC practices.
