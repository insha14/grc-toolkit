# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 — Summary

## 1. Overview
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a globally recognized model that helps organizations understand, manage, and reduce cybersecurity risk.  
It is flexible and can be used by organizations of any size or industry.

CSF 2.0 is organized into six core functions that represent the lifecycle of cybersecurity risk management.

## 2. The Six Core Functions

### 1. Govern
Defines cybersecurity governance, risk strategy, roles, responsibilities, and policy oversight.  
**Examples:** establishing a cybersecurity risk strategy, defining roles, approving policies.

### 2. Identify
Focuses on understanding assets, systems, data, business context, and threats.  
**Examples:** asset inventory, business environment analysis, vulnerability identification.

### 3. Protect
Implements safeguards to ensure the delivery of critical services.  
**Examples:** access control, MFA, data security, secure configuration, awareness training.

### 4. Detect
Identifies cybersecurity events in a timely manner.  
**Examples:** log monitoring, SIEM alerts, anomaly detection.

### 5. Respond
Takes action regarding detected cybersecurity incidents.  
**Examples:** incident response procedures, containment, communication, mitigation steps.

### 6. Recover
Restores capabilities or services after a cybersecurity incident and improves processes.  
**Examples:** restoring systems from backups, recovery planning, post-incident reviews.

## 3. CSF 2.0 Structure
Each Function contains **Categories**, which are further broken down into **Subcategories**.  
Example:  
Protect → Access Control → Implement least privilege.

This structure makes CSF easy to understand and map to other frameworks.

## 4. Why CSF Is Important for GRC
- Helps with policy development  
- Simplifies risk assessments  
- Maps easily to ISO 27001, SOC 2, and CIS Controls  
- Provides common language for auditors and risk teams  
- Widely used across industries and government organizations

## 5. How This Fits Into the Toolkit
This framework will support your work in:  
- Policy writing  
- Control mapping  
- Risk assessments  
- Audit preparation  
- Security governance documentation

More framework summaries will be added to this section as the toolkit grows.
