# SOC 2 — Trust Services Criteria (TSC) Summary

## Overview
SOC 2 is a widely used compliance framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). It evaluates how well an organization manages customer data across five core principles known as the Trust Services Criteria (TSC). SOC 2 is especially important for technology companies, cloud providers, SaaS platforms, and organizations that store or process data on behalf of clients. Unlike other security frameworks, SOC 2 focuses heavily on internal controls, documentation, monitoring, and operational effectiveness.

## Trust Services Criteria

### Security (Mandatory)
Security is the foundational criterion for every SOC 2 audit. It focuses on protecting systems and data against unauthorized access, disclosure, and damage. Controls under this category include access management, logging and monitoring, incident response, system hardening, and change management. Every SOC 2 report must address security, regardless of which additional criteria an organization chooses.

### Availability
Availability ensures that systems and services are accessible and operating reliably as committed to customers. This includes capacity planning, performance monitoring, backup processes, redundancy, failover mechanisms, and disaster recovery planning. Availability does not measure system uptime itself, but evaluates whether controls exist to support promised availability levels.

### Processing Integrity
Processing Integrity addresses whether system processing is accurate, complete, valid, timely, and authorized. This applies primarily to organizations where system outputs directly affect customer transactions or reporting. Controls focus on data validation, quality checks, error handling, and monitoring of processing activities.

### Confidentiality
Confidentiality relates to protecting information designated as confidential. This may include business plans, internal documents, customer lists, or intellectual property. Controls typically include encryption, secure transmission, classification processes, restricted access, and proper data destruction procedures.

### Privacy
Privacy applies specifically to personal data and evaluates how organizations collect, use, retain, disclose, and dispose of personal information according to commitments and legal requirements. It includes consent mechanisms, notice and transparency, data minimization, individual rights, and controls for handling personal information securely.

## SOC 2 Report Types
SOC 2 reports come in two forms. A **Type I** report evaluates whether controls are designed appropriately at a specific point in time. A **Type II** report evaluates the design **and operational effectiveness** of controls over a period (commonly 3–12 months). Type II reports are more valuable, as they demonstrate consistency and reliability of security practices.

## Importance for GRC Work
SOC 2 is one of the most requested compliance frameworks in vendor assessments and is a common requirement for business partnerships, especially in cloud and SaaS environments. It emphasizes documentation, monitoring, risk assessment, and governance — all central to GRC roles. Understanding SOC 2 prepares you to support audits, build controls, create evidence, and work effectively with compliance teams.

## Role in This Toolkit
This summary establishes the foundation for future sections such as audit checklists, evidence documentation templates, and control mappings. As the toolkit expands, examples of SOC 2 evidence, policy requirements, and audit preparation workflows will be included to support hands-on learning.
