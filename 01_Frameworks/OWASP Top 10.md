# OWASP Top 10 — Summary

## Overview
The OWASP Top 10 is a widely recognized list of the most critical security risks affecting web applications. Published by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), it serves as a foundational reference for developers, auditors, security teams, and compliance professionals. The goal of the OWASP Top 10 is to increase awareness of common vulnerabilities, promote secure coding practices, and guide organizations in assessing and prioritizing application security risks.

## Purpose of the OWASP Top 10
OWASP does not prescribe strict controls; instead, it highlights areas where applications are most commonly exploited. Organizations use the Top 10 to build secure development programs, train developers, design testing procedures, and evaluate third-party applications. For GRC work, understanding these risks is essential when assessing vendor security, reviewing development policies, or interpreting vulnerability reports.

## Summary of the Top 10 Risks
The OWASP Top 10 covers a range of risks, including broken access control, cryptographic failures, injection attacks, insecure design, security misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities related to outdated components. Additional risks include insufficient identification and authentication, security logging and monitoring deficiencies, server-side request forgery (SSRF), and issues arising from weak software integrity controls. These categories reflect real-world attack patterns and evolving threats in modern applications.

## Importance for GRC Work
Although the OWASP Top 10 is technical, its relevance to GRC is significant. Many compliance frameworks require secure software development practices, vulnerability management, and regular application testing. Understanding OWASP risks enables you to interpret penetration test results, communicate effectively with development teams, and include appropriate controls in policies and risk assessments. It also strengthens vendor management reviews by allowing you to evaluate whether third-party applications follow secure development standards.

## Role in This Toolkit
This summary provides a baseline understanding of common application security risks. As the toolkit develops, additional documents may include secure coding guidelines, vulnerability classification examples, and mappings between OWASP risks and broader frameworks such as NIST CSF, ISO 27001, and SOC 2. This helps integrate application security considerations into your broader GRC practice.
