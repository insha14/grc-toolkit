# ISO 27001:2022 — Summary

## Overview
ISO 27001 is an international standard for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS). It provides a structured approach for managing sensitive information so that it remains secure, focusing on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The most recent version, ISO 27001:2022, includes updated Annex A controls aligned with modern security practices and threats.

## Structure of the Standard
ISO 27001 is divided into two major parts: the management system requirements (Clauses 4–10) and the Annex A controls. Clauses outline how an organization should build and maintain its ISMS, covering areas such as leadership involvement, risk assessment, documentation, and continuous improvement. Annex A includes 93 controls grouped into four themes designed to reduce information security risks systematically.

## Annex A Control Themes

### 1. Organizational Controls
Organizational controls define governance mechanisms and responsibilities related to security. These include establishing policies, assigning roles, managing risks, ensuring compliance, and maintaining documented procedures. They help ensure security is integrated into the business structure and not handled in isolation.

### 2. People Controls
People controls address human-related risks such as insider threats, lack of awareness, and insufficient training. These controls include background verification, user responsibilities, security awareness programs, and disciplinary processes. Their focus is ensuring that individuals understand and uphold security obligations.

### 3. Physical Controls
Physical controls protect facilities, equipment, and environments where information is processed or stored. Examples include secure areas, entry controls, protection of equipment, and safeguards against environmental hazards. These controls reduce risks associated with unauthorized physical access or damage to assets.

### 4. Technological Controls
Technological controls cover measures such as access management, encryption, logging, monitoring, secure configuration, backup, and vulnerability management. These controls ensure that technology is deployed securely and monitored effectively to prevent, detect, or respond to cyber threats.

## Importance for GRC Work
ISO 27001 is widely used across industries and often required for compliance, vendor onboarding, and client assurance. It supports structured risk management, aligns with audits, and provides a global benchmark for evaluating an organization’s security posture. Because many companies base their policies and security programs on ISO 27001, understanding its structure and controls is essential for roles in governance, risk, and compliance.

## Role in This Toolkit
This summary provides a foundation for creating policies, performing security assessments, and mapping controls to other frameworks such as NIST CSF, SOC 2, and CIS Controls. As the toolkit expands, detailed mappings and sample audit checklists based on ISO 27001 will be added to support practical GRC work.
