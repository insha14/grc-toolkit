# MITRE ATT&CK — Summary

## Overview
MITRE ATT&CK is a globally recognized knowledge base that documents real-world adversary behaviors. It provides a structured way to understand how attackers operate by categorizing tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in cyber intrusions. The framework is widely adopted by security teams, threat intelligence analysts, and incident responders to map attacks, improve detection capabilities, and strengthen defense strategies.

## Structure of the Framework
MITRE ATT&CK is organized into tactics, which describe the adversary’s goals during an attack, and techniques, which describe the specific methods used to achieve those goals. Tactics include areas such as Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Lateral Movement, and Exfiltration. Each technique includes examples, detection guidance, and mitigations. This structure allows organizations to analyze attacker behavior in a consistent and repeatable way.

## Purpose and Usage
The framework helps organizations understand how attackers progress through an environment and which weaknesses they exploit. It is frequently used to assess detection coverage, design incident response playbooks, and validate the effectiveness of security controls. While highly technical, MITRE ATT&CK supports broader governance and risk management by enabling more informed discussions about threat scenarios and control effectiveness.

## Importance for GRC Work
Although MITRE ATT&CK is primarily used by technical security teams, it plays an indirect but valuable role in GRC. Understanding common adversary behaviors helps strengthen risk assessments, inform policy requirements, and improve incident response planning. It also supports communication between governance teams and technical analysts by providing a shared language for discussing threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigations.

## Role in This Toolkit
This summary completes the foundational framework section of the toolkit. As the project develops, references to MITRE ATT&CK may be used in incident scenarios, risk discussions, and control mappings. Its inclusion ensures that both governance and technical perspectives are represented within the overall GRC learning framework.
