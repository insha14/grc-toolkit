📄 NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 – Summary
1. Overview

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a globally recognized model that helps organizations understand, manage, and reduce cybersecurity risk.
It is framework-agnostic, meaning it can be used by companies of any size and industry.

CSF 2.0 organizes cybersecurity activities into 6 Core Functions, which act as the high-level pillars of a security program.

## 2. The Six Core Functions

These functions represent the lifecycle of managing cybersecurity risk.

1) Govern

Establishes the organization’s cybersecurity risk management strategy, roles, policies, and oversight.

Includes:

Risk management strategy

Cybersecurity supply chain risk management

Roles, responsibilities, and accountability

Policy development

Real-world example:
Creating a security governance committee and defining who approves policies.

2) Identify

Understand what needs protection.

Includes:

Asset management

Business environment

Threat intelligence

Vulnerability identification

Example:
Maintaining an updated inventory of laptops, servers, cloud services, and data assets.

3) Protect

Implement safeguards to keep systems and data secure.

Includes:

Access control

Data security

Secure configuration

Awareness training

Multi-factor authentication

Example:
Requiring MFA for all users and enforcing password complexity policies.

4) Detect

Find cybersecurity events early.

Includes:

Log monitoring

Anomaly detection

Security monitoring tools

Continuous analysis

Example:
A SIEM alert triggers when unusual login patterns occur after midnight.

5) Respond

Take action when an incident is detected.

Includes:

Incident response planning

Communication

Mitigation

Improvements

Example:
Activating the incident response team after detecting ransomware.

6) Recover

Return to normal operations and learn from incidents.

Includes:

Disaster recovery

Business continuity

Post-incident reviews

Restoration of services

Example:
Restoring data from backups after a cyberattack and updating the response plan.

## 3. CSF 2.0 Structure

Each Function → contains Categories → each Category → contains Subcategories (specific outcomes).

Example:
Protect → Access Control → “Use least privilege principles.”

This makes CSF easy to understand and implement incrementally.

## 4. Why CSF Matters (Especially in GRC Roles)

Helps organizations reduce cyber risk in a structured way

Useful for policy creation and risk assessments

Maps easily to ISO 27001, SOC 2, and CIS Controls

Provides shared language for audits and reporting

Used across industries, governments, and enterprises
