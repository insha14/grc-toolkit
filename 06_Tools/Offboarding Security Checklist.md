# Offboarding Security Checklist

## Overview
The Offboarding Security Checklist ensures that access, data, and assets associated with departing employees, contractors, or third-party users are securely removed. This prevents unauthorized access after termination and protects the organization from data loss, insider threats, and compliance violations.

## Objective
The objective of this checklist is to provide IT, HR, and security teams with a structured process to ensure all offboarding activities are executed promptly and documented accurately.

## Checklist Items

### HR Notification
- Receive official notification of termination or role change.
- Confirm termination date, time, and whether access should be removed immediately.
- Identify whether the termination is voluntary or involuntary (for urgency level).

### Access Removal

- Disable email account and revoke mailbox access.
- Remove user from all groups, roles, and distribution lists.

### Data Handling & Ownership

## Role in This Toolkit
This checklist pairs with the Onboarding Checklist and Access Review Checklist to demonstrate complete identity lifecycle governance, a core requirement for ITGC compliance, SOC 2 audits, and ISO 27001 implementation.
