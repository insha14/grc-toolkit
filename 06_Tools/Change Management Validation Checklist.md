# Change Management Validation Checklist

## Overview
The Change Management Validation Checklist provides a structured method for confirming that changes to production systems were properly documented, approved, tested, and implemented. This checklist is commonly used during ITGC audits and internal reviews to ensure that the change management process is consistently followed and that risks associated with system changes are minimized.

## Objective
The objective of this checklist is to help auditors, system owners, and compliance teams evaluate whether a change meets organizational and regulatory expectations for documentation, risk assessment, and control effectiveness.

## Checklist Items

### Change Documentation
- A formal change request exists in the change management system.
- The change ticket includes a clear description and business justification.
- All impacted systems, services, and users are documented.
- The change is categorized correctly (standard, normal, emergency).

### Risk and Impact Assessment
- A risk assessment was completed for the change.
- Potential impacts to confidentiality, integrity, and availability are documented.
- Dependencies and upstream/downstream systems were identified.
- High-risk changes include additional review or approvals.

### Approval and Authorization
- Required approvals were obtained prior to implementation.
- Emergency changes were documented and approved retroactively.
- Change Advisory Board (CAB) reviewed and approved change (if applicable).

### Testing and Validation
- Testing was performed in a non-production environment.
- Test results were documented and attached to the change ticket.
- Security impact assessments were completed (if applicable).
- Rollback procedures were validated and available prior to deployment.

### Implementation
- The change was deployed according to the approved implementation plan.
- Deployment occurred during the approved maintenance window.
- Notifications were sent to impacted stakeholders before deployment.
- Any issues during deployment were documented.

### Post-Implementation Review
- The team verified system functionality after deployment.
- Logs and monitoring tools were reviewed for anomalies.
- The success or failure of the change was documented.
- Lessons learned or improvement recommendations were recorded.

### Closure
- The change request was formally closed in the system.
- All relevant documentation (testing, approvals, evidence) is stored.
- Evidence is accessible for audit and compliance purposes.

## Role in This Toolkit
This checklist strengthens your Change Management section by providing a practical audit validation tool. It demonstrates your understanding of ITGC controls, compliance expectations, and operational governance processes.
