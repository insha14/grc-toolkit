# Risk Acceptance Form

## Overview
The Risk Acceptance Form is used when an organization chooses to accept a documented risk rather than mitigate, transfer, or avoid it. This decision is typically made when the residual risk falls within the organization's risk appetite or when mitigation is not feasible due to cost, resources, or business impact.

## Purpose
This form provides a standardized method for documenting acceptance decisions, ensuring that risk owners and leadership understand the associated implications and take responsibility for the chosen outcome. It also supports audit and compliance requirements for formal risk governance.
