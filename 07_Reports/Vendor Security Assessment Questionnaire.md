# Vendor Security Assessment Questionnaire

## Overview
The Vendor Security Assessment Questionnaire is used to evaluate the security posture of third-party vendors before they are onboarded or granted access to organizational systems or data. This assessment helps identify risks related to data handling, operational security, compliance, and incident response capabilities.

## Purpose
This questionnaire provides a structured method for collecting information from vendors, ensuring their controls meet organizational and regulatory expectations (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR). It supports vendor risk scoring and onboarding decisions.
