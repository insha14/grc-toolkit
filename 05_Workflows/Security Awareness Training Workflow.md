# Security Awareness Training Workflow

## Overview
The Security Awareness Training Workflow describes the steps an organization follows to ensure employees understand cybersecurity risks, best practices, and their responsibilities. Regular training reduces human error, strengthens security culture, and supports compliance with industry standards and regulations.

## Objective
The objective of this workflow is to provide a structured and repeatable process for planning, delivering, tracking, and documenting security awareness training for all employees, contractors, and relevant third parties.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Identify Training Requirements
The security or compliance team defines training topics based on organizational risks, regulatory requirements, recent incidents, and audit findings. Core topics typically include phishing awareness, password hygiene, data handling, incident reporting, and acceptable use guidelines.

### 2. Assign Training to Employees
HR or the Learning Management System (LMS) assigns required training modules to all new hires and existing employees. Department-specific training may be assigned based on job roles or system access levels.

### 3. Deliver Training Content
Employees receive training through an LMS, virtual sessions, recorded videos, or in-person sessions. The content should be engaging, relevant, and updated regularly to address emerging threats and evolving best practices.

### 4. Track Completion and Performance
System owners monitor training participation and completion status. Completion records, quiz scores, and attendance logs are documented. Employees who fail to complete training on time may receive reminders or escalations.

### 5. Conduct Phishing Simulations (Optional)
Periodic phishing simulations may be used to measure employees’ susceptibility to phishing attacks. Results help identify areas where additional training or targeted coaching may be required.

### 6. Address Non-Compliance
Employees who do not complete mandatory training must receive follow-ups, reminders, or managerial escalation. Persistent non-compliance may lead to administrative consequences depending on organizational policy.

### 7. Evaluate Training Effectiveness
The security team reviews training metrics, simulation outcomes, incident trends, and feedback to assess the effectiveness of the program. Improvements or adjustments are made based on insights gathered.

### 8. Document and Report
Training records, attendance logs, simulation data, and program summaries are retained as evidence for audits and regulatory compliance. Reports may be shared with leadership or internal audit teams.

## Role in This Toolkit
This workflow demonstrates operational understanding of a foundational cybersecurity control. It supports the Acceptable Use Policy, Incident Response Policy, and Vendor Risk Management processes by ensuring that all users are educated on their security responsibilities.
