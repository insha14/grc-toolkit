# User Access Review Workflow

## Overview
The User Access Review Workflow outlines the steps for reviewing user access to systems and data to ensure permissions remain appropriate and aligned with the principle of least privilege. This workflow helps identify excessive privileges, inactive accounts, and unauthorized access, supporting organizational security and compliance requirements.

## Objective
The objective of this workflow is to provide a consistent and repeatable process for conducting periodic access reviews across all critical applications, infrastructure systems, and cloud environments.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Identify Systems Requiring Review
The system owner or security team compiles a list of all applications and systems that require periodic access reviews. Critical systems or systems handling sensitive data should be prioritized.

### 2. Export User Access Lists
Administrators export the most current list of active users and their associated roles or permissions from each system. The export must include usernames, roles, last login dates, and privileged access indicators.

### 3. Validate Active User Population
The reviewer confirms that all users in the export are still employed or authorized to access the system. HR rosters or employee status reports are referenced to identify terminated or inactive users.

### 4. Review Role Appropriateness
The reviewer evaluates whether each user’s access aligns with their job responsibilities. Excessive permissions, unnecessary admin roles, or outdated access should be flagged for remediation.

### 5. Identify and Document Exceptions
Any discrepancies—such as privileged access without justification, dormant accounts, or misaligned access—must be recorded with detailed notes. Each exception is assigned to the relevant system owner or manager for correction.

### 6. Submit Remediation Requests
If access changes are needed, the reviewer creates tickets or requests in the appropriate system to remove or modify permissions. Evidence of these requests should be retained for audit purposes.

### 7. Review Completion and Sign-Off
After remediation actions are completed, the reviewer validates that all changes were implemented correctly. The final access review report is then approved and signed off by the system owner or designated manager.

### 8. Store Documentation
All exports, review notes, remediation evidence, and approvals are securely stored in a central repository. Documentation must be retained according to recordkeeping policies and audit requirements.

## Role in This Toolkit
This workflow complements the Access Review Checklist and supports audit readiness, SOC 2 requirements, and ITGC control evaluations. Additional workflows may build upon this structure to provide a full governance process library.
