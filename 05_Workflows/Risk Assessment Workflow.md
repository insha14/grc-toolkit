# Risk Assessment Workflow

## Overview
The Risk Assessment Workflow provides a structured process for identifying, analyzing, and evaluating cybersecurity risks within an organization. It ensures that risks are assessed consistently, prioritized appropriately, and documented clearly in the risk register. This workflow supports decision-making around mitigation strategies and aligns with the organization’s broader governance and compliance activities.

## Objective
The objective of this workflow is to define a repeatable method for conducting risk assessments, enabling stakeholders to understand potential threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts in a systematic way.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Define Scope and Objectives
Identify the systems, processes, data, or business functions to be evaluated. Clarify the purpose of the assessment—whether supporting compliance, project planning, audits, or general risk governance.

### 2. Identify Assets and Stakeholders
Catalog the assets within the scope, such as systems, applications, data types, or processes. Identify asset owners, system administrators, and relevant stakeholders who can provide insights into risks.

### 3. Identify Threats and Vulnerabilities
Work with technical and process owners to identify relevant threats (e.g., unauthorized access, system failure, malware) and associated vulnerabilities (e.g., misconfigurations, outdated software, lack of controls). Document all findings.

### 4. Assess Likelihood
Evaluate the probability that a threat may exploit a vulnerability. Use qualitative ratings (Low, Medium, High) based on exposure, control strength, known incidents, and threat activity. Document the justification for each rating.

### 5. Assess Impact
Evaluate the potential consequences if the risk materializes. Consider impacts to confidentiality, integrity, availability, regulatory compliance, financial harm, and reputation. Rate each impact as Low, Medium, or High, with justification.

### 6. Determine Inherent Risk Rating
Combine likelihood and impact to determine the inherent risk level. Use a qualitative matrix or methodology defined in the toolkit. Record the rating clearly in the risk register.

### 7. Identify Existing Controls
Document controls already in place to address the risk (e.g., MFA, patching processes, backups). Assess control effectiveness based on maturity, coverage, automation, and monitoring practices.

### 8. Recommend Mitigation Actions
If the inherent risk is above acceptable levels, propose mitigation actions such as new controls, enhanced processes, or policy updates. Record recommended treatments and assign responsibilities.

### 9. Determine Residual Risk
After considering existing and planned controls, evaluate the remaining level of risk. Document whether the residual risk is acceptable or requires further action.

### 10. Obtain Approval and Finalize Documentation
Review findings with the risk owner or leadership. Once approved, upload the completed assessment to the risk repository and ensure it is reflected in the risk register.

## Role in This Toolkit
This workflow brings together all elements of the Risk Management section and demonstrates practical understanding of how risk assessments are conducted. It is particularly useful for supporting internal audits, compliance programs, vendor assessments, and security governance activities.
