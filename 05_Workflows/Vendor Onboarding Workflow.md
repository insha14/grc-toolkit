# Vendor Onboarding Workflow

## Overview
The Vendor Onboarding Workflow outlines the steps required to evaluate, approve, and onboard third-party vendors who will access, process, or store organizational data. This workflow ensures that vendors are reviewed for security, compliance, and operational risks before a contract is signed or services are activated.

## Objective
The objective of this workflow is to provide a consistent and rigorous process for assessing vendor risks, collecting necessary documentation, and ensuring that appropriate controls and contractual safeguards are in place before onboarding.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Identify Vendor Need and Initiate Request
The requesting department identifies the need for a new vendor and submits a vendor onboarding request. The request includes service description, data types involved, and expected system access. The vendor is classified based on potential risk level.

### 2. Conduct Initial Risk Classification
The vendor is classified as Low, Medium, or High risk based on criteria such as data sensitivity, access requirements, regulatory obligations, and business criticality. Higher-risk vendors require more extensive assessments.

### 3. Perform Security Assessment
The security or risk team conducts a thorough evaluation of the vendor. This may include:
- Security questionnaires  
- SOC 2 or ISO 27001 reports  
- Penetration test summaries  
- Data protection practices  
- Incident history  
- Cloud security posture  
Assessment results are documented and reviewed with stakeholders.

### 4. Review and Approve Contractual Requirements
Legal, procurement, and security teams review the vendor contract. Required clauses may include:
- Confidentiality obligations  
- Breach notification timelines  
- Data retention and destruction rules  
- Audit rights  
- Security control requirements  
Contractual risks must be addressed before approval.

### 5. Final Approval and Vendor Activation
Once assessment results and contract terms are approved, the vendor is authorized for onboarding. System access, integrations, or accounts can then be created following the Access Control Policy.

### 6. Configure Access and Monitor Setup
IT or system admins configure vendor access. This includes:
- Role-based access control  
- Least privilege permissions  
- MFA requirements  
- Logging and monitoring  
Documentation of initial setup is stored for audit purposes.

### 7. Track Vendor Performance and Compliance
After onboarding, vendors must be monitored on an ongoing basis. Activities include:
- Reviewing updated SOC reports  
- Monitoring incident notifications  
- Evaluating service performance  
- Reassessing risk annually or after major changes  

### 8. Offboard Vendor When No Longer Needed
If services end, vendor access must be removed promptly. All data must be returned or securely destroyed as per contract requirements. Offboarding actions must be documented.

## Role in This Toolkit
This workflow supports the Vendor Risk Management Policy and provides a complete governance view of third-party onboarding. It demonstrates practical understanding of vendor lifecycle management, a key competency for GRC, compliance, and audit roles.
