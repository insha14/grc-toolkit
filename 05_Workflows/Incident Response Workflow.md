# Incident Response Workflow

## Overview
The Incident Response Workflow outlines the structured steps an organization follows to detect, assess, contain, and recover from cybersecurity incidents. A formal workflow ensures that incidents are handled consistently, efficiently, and in a way that minimizes damage to systems, data, and business operations.

## Objective
The goal of this workflow is to provide a clear sequence of actions and responsibilities to support timely and effective incident response, ensuring alignment with the organization’s Incident Response Policy.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Detection and Identification
Incidents may be detected through automated monitoring systems, user reports, alerts, or unusual system behavior. The security team documents the initial details and conducts preliminary analysis to confirm whether the activity qualifies as a security incident.

### 2. Logging and Classification
Once confirmed, the incident is logged in the incident management system. The incident is classified based on severity, potential impact, and urgency. Classification helps determine resource allocation, escalation requirements, and notification pathways.

### 3. Containment (Short-Term)
Immediate action is taken to prevent further spread or damage. This may include isolating affected systems, disabling compromised accounts, blocking malicious IP addresses, or restricting network access. Short-term containment focuses on stabilizing the environment.

### 4. Containment (Long-Term)
After initial stabilization, longer-term containment measures are implemented. These may include applying temporary patches, updating firewall rules, or migrating services to secure environments. Long-term containment aims to ensure attackers can no longer exploit the issue.

### 5. Eradication
The root cause of the incident is addressed by removing malicious files, closing exploited vulnerabilities, applying required patches, or updating configurations. The security team performs detailed analysis to ensure all traces of the incident are eliminated.

### 6. Recovery
Systems are restored to normal operating condition. This may involve restoring from backups, validating system integrity, and conducting additional monitoring to detect abnormal behavior. Users are informed once systems are safe to resume normal activity.

### 7. Post-Incident Review
After containment, eradication, and recovery, the security team conducts a lessons-learned review. This review examines root causes, the effectiveness of response actions, communication issues, control gaps, and opportunities for improvement. Findings are documented and shared with leadership.

### 8. Documentation and Closure
All logs, timelines, decisions, evidence, and communications are documented. A final incident report is prepared summarizing the event, its impact, actions taken, and recommended improvements. Once all activities are complete, the incident is formally closed.

## Role in This Toolkit
This workflow complements the Incident Response Policy and provides a practical, structured approach to handling cybersecurity incidents. It helps demonstrate operational understanding and supports compliance with frameworks such as ISO 27001, SOC 2, and NIST CSF.
