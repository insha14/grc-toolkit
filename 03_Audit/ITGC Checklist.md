# ITGC Checklist (Information Technology General Controls)

## Overview
Information Technology General Controls (ITGCs) are foundational controls that support the reliability, integrity, and security of an organization’s information systems. They apply across applications and infrastructure and ensure that systems operate consistently and securely. ITGCs are a central focus of internal and external audits because weaknesses in these controls can affect the accuracy of financial reporting, the confidentiality of data, and the organization’s overall security posture.

## Purpose of ITGCs
The purpose of ITGCs is to ensure that systems and data are protected through effective governance, proper access management, secure system changes, and reliable operations. These controls form the baseline for more specialized or application-level controls. When ITGCs are strong, organizations are better positioned to prevent unauthorized access, reduce human errors, and respond effectively to security incidents.

## ITGC Control Areas

### 1. Access Management Controls
Access management ensures that only authorized individuals have access to systems, data, and applications. Controls in this category include user provisioning and deprovisioning, periodic access reviews, privileged access management, password policies, and MFA enforcement. Auditors review whether access rights align with job responsibilities and whether inactive or terminated accounts are removed in a timely manner.

### 2. Change Management Controls
Change management ensures that system and application changes are authorized, tested, and documented before implementation. This includes updates, patches, configuration changes, and new deployments. Auditors examine whether changes follow a structured approval process, whether testing is performed, and whether emergency changes are monitored and reviewed.

### 3. IT Operations Controls
IT operations controls focus on the daily processes that keep systems running securely and reliably. These include backup procedures, job scheduling, logging and monitoring, incident handling, and system performance management. Auditors evaluate whether backups are performed and tested regularly, whether logs are reviewed, and whether incidents are documented and resolved appropriately.

## ITGC Checklist Template

| Control Category | Control Area | Description | Evidence Examples | Status |
|------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| Access Management | User Provisioning | Users are granted access based on job requirements. | Access request forms, approval tickets | |
| Access Management | Deprovisioning | Access is removed promptly when users leave the organization. | Termination logs, HR system reports | |
| Access Management | Privileged Access | Elevated access is restricted and monitored. | Admin account logs, PAM reports | |
| Change Management | Change Requests | All changes are documented and approved before implementation. | Change tickets, approval workflows | |
| Change Management | Testing and Validation | Changes are tested to ensure functionality and security. | Test logs, QA evidence | |
| IT Operations | Backup Management | Backups are performed and tested regularly. | Backup reports, restoration logs | |
| IT Operations | Logging and Monitoring | System activity is logged and reviewed. | SIEM screens, log review reports | |
| IT Operations | Incident Management | Security incidents are recorded and resolved. | Incident tickets, root cause analysis | |

## Role in This Toolkit
This ITGC checklist provides a foundation for understanding how auditors evaluate core security controls. As the toolkit expands, additional documents such as access review procedures, evidence request lists, and sample audit reports will build on these concepts. This checklist can also be adapted and used during assessments, internal audits, and compliance reviews.
