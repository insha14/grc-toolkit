# Evidence Request List

## Overview
An evidence request list outlines the documentation, screenshots, reports, and records that auditors require to verify whether controls are designed and operating effectively. Providing clear and organized evidence is essential for completing internal audits, SOC 2 assessments, ISO certifications, and ITGC reviews. This list summarizes commonly requested evidence across key control areas to support audit readiness and streamline communication between auditors and control owners.

## Purpose of Evidence Requests
Evidence requests help auditors confirm that policies are in place, controls are functioning as intended, and activities such as access reviews, backups, and change approvals are properly documented. Clear evidence reduces audit delays, prevents misunderstandings, and strengthens the reliability of audit conclusions. Well-prepared evidence also demonstrates organizational maturity and strong governance practices.

## Role in This Toolkit
This evidence request list helps you understand what auditors typically expect and how organizations prepare for assessments. It will later support additional resources such as sample audit reports, audit workflows, and templates for tracking evidence submissions. As the toolkit expands, more detailed evidence guidance may be added for SOC 2, ISO 27001, and ITGC-specific reviews.
