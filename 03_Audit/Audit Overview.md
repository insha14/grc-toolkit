# Audit Overview

## Overview
An audit is a structured evaluation of how well an organization’s processes, controls, and systems align with defined standards, policies, or regulatory requirements. In cybersecurity and GRC, audits help verify that security controls are designed effectively, implemented correctly, and operating as intended. Audits also provide assurance to management, customers, and external stakeholders that risks are being managed responsibly.

## Purpose of an Audit
The primary purpose of an audit is to assess whether controls adequately protect the organization from threats and support compliance obligations. Audits may be internal, conducted by the organization’s own audit or compliance teams, or external, performed by independent auditors. The audit process identifies strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement, enabling the organization to enhance its governance and security posture.

## Types of Audits
Common audits in cybersecurity and GRC include IT General Controls (ITGC) audits, application audits, security compliance assessments (such as ISO 27001 or SOC 2), and operational audits focusing on processes like change management or incident response. Each type of audit examines specific controls and evidence to determine whether they meet expected requirements.

## Audit Lifecycle
A typical audit follows a structured lifecycle. It begins with planning, where the scope, objectives, and criteria are defined. Fieldwork follows, during which auditors gather evidence, review documentation, interview personnel, and test controls. After fieldwork, auditors evaluate findings, prepare reports, and communicate results to management. The final phase involves follow-up activities to ensure that remediation actions are implemented appropriately.

## Role in GRC Work
Audits are central to governance, risk, and compliance programs because they validate whether controls are working effectively. GRC professionals participate in preparing evidence, documenting procedures, coordinating remediation, and improving processes based on audit results. Understanding the audit lifecycle and common control areas is essential for supporting internal and external audit engagements.

## Role in This Toolkit
This overview introduces the core concepts needed to understand subsequent documents in the Audit section, including checklists, evidence requests, and sample audit reports. As the toolkit develops, additional audit-specific resources will be added to support hands-on learning and practical experience.
